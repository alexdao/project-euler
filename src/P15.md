There are 40 moves total needed to reach the bottom right corner of a 20x20 grid: 20 moves right and 20 moves down.
Consider just the moves right. We have 40 spaces to fill and 20 moves, so the total ways we can place the moves is C(40,20).
The rest of the spaces can just be filled with down moves.
