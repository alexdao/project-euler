2520 is the smallest number that can be divided from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
We can start with 2520 and only consider numbers from 11-20. We have to multiply by all prime numbers (11, 13, 17, 19).

There is one special case for the number 16. The prime factorization of 2520 only contains 3 2s. We need one more 2 to have 16.

Every other number can be constructed as a product of the prime factorization.
